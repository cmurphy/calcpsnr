PSNR Calculator
==============

Input: Two PPM or PGM files of the same size. One is typically an original, high-quality image, and the second is a compressed version of it. For instance, you can take an original JPEG image and export a degraded quality versioin of it, then use the jpegtopnm utility or other similar utility from netpbm to get PPM or PGM files.

Output: The PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) of the images.
